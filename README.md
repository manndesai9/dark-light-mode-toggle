Dark/Light Mode Toggle Project
Hey there! Welcome to my first JavaScript project where I built a dark/light mode toggle. It‚Äôs a simple but cool little feature where you can switch the webpage‚Äôs theme from light mode to dark mode (and vice versa) just by clicking a button. I built this to get hands-on with JavaScript and CSS while keeping it easy and clean.

What's In This Project:
A Button to Toggle Modes: A button that switches the webpage between dark and light themes.

Smooth Transitions: I made sure the transition between light and dark mode is smooth, so it doesn‚Äôt feel jarring.

Basic and Clean Design: Simple but effective design with the content centered on the page. Nothing too fancy, but it looks neat and functions well.

Tech Stack:
HTML: For the page structure.

CSS: To make things look good, with transitions for the mode switch.

JavaScript: To make the dark/light mode toggle work when you click the button.

How It Works:
When you open the page, it's set to light mode (white background and black text).

Clicking the button will switch between dark mode (black background and white text) and light mode.

The transition between modes is smooth, thanks to the CSS transitions I added.

What I Did:
Created the Design: Used simple Flexbox to center everything, making the page look clean and easy to navigate.

Built the Toggle: Implemented the JS code for the button to switch between dark and light modes.

Made It Responsive: The page looks good on any screen size (just the basics for now, but it‚Äôs clean and functional).

What‚Äôs Next:
In the future, I plan to add icons to the button to make it more intuitive (maybe a moon üåô for dark mode and sun ‚òÄÔ∏è for light mode).

I‚Äôd also like to play around with fonts and maybe add a bit more interactivity, but for now, this is a solid start.
